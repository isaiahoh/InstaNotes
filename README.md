# InstaSnap

## A React-JS app built with React-Native, Expo and Google Cloud libraries.

## What is it?
* An experiment in using Google Cloud Services and optical processing
* The idea is to have an app that can take pictures of notes on a board/screen, then generate a text file of the writing detected in the      image
* The option to export these text files to Google Drive

## TO-DO
* Integrate the image processing tool into the main app
* Display a gallery of pictures taken through the app
* Display a list of text files generated by the app
* Add a tutorial on the Home Screen swiper interface

## Completed
* Tested Google Cloud's API for image processing, proven successful to generate text files based on supplied images
* Added a basic Camera tab to the main app, this is where pictures can be taken and are saved
* Added swiper interface on Home screen

### Build/Library Dependencies

```bash
$ npm install react-native
$ npm install expo-cli -global
$ npm install react-swipeable-tabs --save
$ npm install react-native-swiper
```
* Some of these require peer dependencies that npm will not automatically install
* Run: `$ npm audit fix` to display these peer dependencies


### Setup
* First install all the dependencies within the app directory
* Connect Android or IOS device to the computer using a USB cable(Make sure to have developer options on)
* Run `$ expo start` within the app directory
* A preview of the app will pop-up on the device's screen

### Resources
* [Expo](https://expo.io/)
